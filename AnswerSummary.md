# Java Basic Primitive Type Practice
## Boolean Operation test
 1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The point is about [different number system in computer](https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-Hexadecimal-to-Binary-or-Decimal) and [bit-wise operation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) 
 

## Char Type Test
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The point is about [Escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)
 
## Floating Type Test
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
- The point is about [Float & Double](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## Integer Type Test
- The point is about [Integer](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/98au/java/jdk1.2beta4/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html)
- [Increment Operator](https://www.dyclassroom.com/java/java-increment-decrement-operators)
- [assertThrows()](https://howtodoinjava.com/junit5/expected-exception-example/)

2.Why the test failed at first?
- It's because the expected result is originally set to 0 or some pre-fixed value while "assertEquals()/assertThrows()" compare the expected and the actual result and output a Boolean as the comparison result. 

3.Why you corrected the test that way?
- So that the expected result should be matched to the actual result which is stated in each unit test

4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
 - Should be okay
